# Advanced Functions

## What is recursion?

Recursion is the act of a functino calling itself. It is often used to solve problems that have their own internal problems to solve. 

A recursive function can recieve two inputs:
1. a base case (This is the case that would end the recursion)
2. a recursive case (This is a case that would resume the recursion)

The example below is a very simple function that gives you a good idea of what a recursive function looks like
and how it operates.

`def recurse(x):`
  ` if x > 0:`
       `print(x)`
       `recurse(x - 1)`

`recurse(10)`
