# My Name is Sarah Mendez
I am a Web Developer based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. I am 27 years old and a dog mom of four dogs. Some might say that is too many and honestly I would agree. I moved in with my boyfriend and we are both dog lovers so after combining household we endup up with four dogs! I have a lot of hobbies. I love Yoga and I am a certified Yoga instructor. I love wine, good food, gardening, and this all fits together quite nicely because my Boyfriend is a chef. I love my nintendo switch so much, it's a great way to wind down and shut my mind off at the end of the day. Of course I also love computers, desiging, and playing with code. I would say I'm a creative person naturally becuase I am curious. I believe creativity and curiosity go hand in hand. I have taken two JavaScript Courses at UVU and I also started a beginner JavaScript course on Udemy to refine and cement some knowledge into place. I think understanding the nuances of the basics is incredibly important. You have to have a solid foundation to grow off of or I could see it getting tricky down the road. I love web Development because I get to work independently most of the time which I enjoy. I like listening to music and getting in the zone and figuring out how to make things work. I hope that I can learn some new JavaScript Information and have some solid coding projects to add to my portfolio.
