# My Name is Sarah Mendez
I am a Web Developer based out of Salt Lake City, Utah. I am 27 years old and a dog mom of four dogs. Some might say that is too many, I would agree. I moved in with my boyfriend and we are both dog lovers so we ended up with four dogs. Well that's just life I suppose. Peek around and see some sick content on my awesome blog.
